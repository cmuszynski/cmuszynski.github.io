      <h1><a href="http://rotonomics.com/posts/2013/05/15/sabermetrics-definitions/" rel="bookmark">Sabermetrics&nbsp;Definitions</a></h1>
      
      <p><strong><span class="caps">BA</span>: Batting Average</strong>     <code>(H/AB)</code> </p>
<p>The rate at which a player gets a hit relative to his total at-bats. The average <span class="caps">BA</span> in 
the Majors for 2011 was&nbsp;.255.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">BABIP</span>: Batting Average on Balls in Play</strong>*        <code>(H - HR)/(AB - K - HR + SF)</code></p>
<p>How many of a player&#8217;s balls in play go for hits. <span class="caps">BABIP</span> removes <span class="caps">HR</span>, <span class="caps">BB</span>, and K
&#8212; outcomes not impacted by defense &#8212; from the player&#8217;s average. It can serve as
a rough estimate of a player&#8217;s luck, and can help predict future performance.
The league rate stays around .300 (it was .295 in 2011). A higher <span class="caps">BABIP</span> often
means a player is on the right side of luck (hits are falling in) and will
regress. A lower number often implies a player is on the wrong side of luck and
will improve. The metric can be used mostly for pitchers, and somewhat for&nbsp;hitters.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">BB</span>%: Walk percentage</strong>        <code>(BB/PA)</code> </p>
<p>How often a player walks relative to his total plate appearances. The average walk rate 
across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was 8.1%. Jose Bautista walked at a rate of 20.2% in 2011; Yuniesky 
Betancourt,&nbsp;2.7%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">BB</span>/9: Walks Per 9 Innings Pitched</strong>   <code>(BB/IP)*9</code> </p>
<p>How many batters a pitcher walks per nine innings. An excellent <span class="caps">BB</span>/9 is below 2. The 
average <span class="caps">BB</span>/9 across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was 3.1. (Roy Halladay had a <span class="caps">BB</span>/9 of 1.35 for&nbsp;2011.)</p>
<p><strong>K/9: Strikeouts Per 9 Innings Pitched</strong>   <code>(K/IP)*9</code> </p>
<p>How many batters a pitcher strikes out per every 9 innings. An excellent K/9 is 9.0, or 
a batter an inning. The average K/9 across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was&nbsp;7.1.</p>
<p><strong>K%: Strikeout Percentage</strong>    <code>K/PA</code> </p>
<p>How often a batter strikes out relative to his total plate appearances. The average K% 
across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was 18.6%. When Mark Reynolds set the single-season strikeout record 
in 2009 with 223 whiffs, his rate was 33.7%. Placido Polanco&#8217;s career K% entering 2012 
is&nbsp;8.4%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ERA</span>: Earned Run Average</strong> <code>9 * (Earned Runs/IP)</code> </p>
<p>The number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched &#8212; it does not 
include runs which scored because of errors or passed balls. The average <span class="caps">ERA</span> across <span class="caps">MLB</span> 
in 2011 was&nbsp;3.94.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ERA</span>+: Adjusted <span class="caps">ERA</span></strong>  <code>(LgERA/ERA) * 100</code> </p>
<p>A pitcher&#8217;s <span class="caps">ERA</span> relative to the league-average <span class="caps">ERA</span> and adjusted for his home ballpark. 
100 is league average, below 100 would be below average; over 100 is above average. A 
150 <span class="caps">ERA</span>+ means the pitcher&#8217;s <span class="caps">ERA</span> is 50% better than a league-average&nbsp;pitcher.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">FIP</span>: Fielding Independent Pitching</strong>      <code>[(HR * 13) + (BB + HBP - IBB)*3 - (K *
2)]/IP</code> </p>
<p>A single, <span class="caps">ERA</span>-like number, focusing on a pitcher&#8217;s K rate, <span class="caps">BB</span> rate and <span class="caps">HR</span>
rate (strikeouts, walks and home runs are not impacted by defense). By limiting
its focus to factors a pitcher can control, <span class="caps">FIP</span> demonstrates a pitcher&#8217;s
effectiveness better than <span class="caps">ERA</span>. The average <span class="caps">FIP</span> across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was&nbsp;3.94.</p>
<p><strong>xFIP: Expected Fielding Independent Pitching</strong>        <code>(FB * .106) * 13 + (BB + HBP - IBB) * 3 - (K * 2))/IP</code></p>
<p>Calculated much like <span class="caps">FIP</span>, but with the home run rate kept at the league-average rate of 
10.6%. (Individual pitchers&#8217; home run rates often vary year to year.) The average xFIP 
in <span class="caps">MLB</span> for 2011 was&nbsp;3.94. </p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">FRS</span>: Fielding Runs&nbsp;Saved</strong></p>
<p>The measure of runs saved beyond what a league-average player at that position might have 
saved. The league average is&nbsp;0.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">RC</span>: Runs Created</strong>    <code>(TB * (H + BB)) / (AB + BB)</code> </p>
<p>An estimation, developed by Bill James, of a player&#8217;s offensive contribution to his team, 
measured in terms of runs. A precursor of wOBA&nbsp;(below).</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">OBP</span>: On Base Percentage</strong>     <code>(H + BB + HBP)/(AB + BB + HBP + SF)</code> </p>
<p>The rate at which a player gets on base relative to his total plate appearances. (PAs
include walks, hit-by-pitch, sacrifice hits and catcher interference; at-bats don&#8217;t.) The 
average on-base percentage in <span class="caps">MLB</span> for 2011 was&nbsp;.321.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">OPS</span>: On Base Percentage Plus Slugging Percentage</strong>        <code>(OBP + SLG)</code> </p>
<p>A single stat that estimates a player&#8217;s offensive production. Note that in <span class="caps">OPS</span>, <span class="caps">OBP</span> and
<span class="caps">SLG</span> are weighted evenly (they&#8217;re summed), despite the two metrics being weighted
differently themselves: <span class="caps">OBP</span> is calculated from plate appearances and <span class="caps">SLG</span> from&nbsp;at-bats.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">OPS</span>+: Adjusted <span class="caps">OPS</span></strong>      <code>100 * ( OBP/lgOBP + SLG/lgSLG - 1)/BPF</code> </p>
<p>A batter&#8217;s <span class="caps">OPS</span> relative to the league-average <span class="caps">OPS</span> and adjusted for his home ballpark. 100 
is league average, anything below 100 is below average; over 100 is above average.
Bautista held a 181 <span class="caps">OPS</span>+ in 2011, meaning his <span class="caps">OPS</span> was 81% better than a league-average&nbsp;hitter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">SLG</span>: Slugging Percentage</strong>        <code>((1B) + (2 * 2B) + (3 * 3B) + (4 * HR))/AB</code> </p>
<p>The rate at which a player gains total bases relative to his total at-bats. The average 
slugging percentage in <span class="caps">MLB</span> for 2011 was&nbsp;.399.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UZR</span>: Ultimate Zone&nbsp;Rating</strong></p>
<p>How many runs above or below average a player was worth defensively. 0.0 is considered 
average. Developed by Mitchel&nbsp;Lichtman.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WAR</span>: Wins Above&nbsp;Replacement</strong></p>
<p>A single statistic summarizing a player&#8217;s offensive and defensive contributions. <span class="caps">WAR</span> 
calculates the amount of wins a player adds to his team compared to the contribution that 
would be expected from a replacement-level player. A replacement-level player is a player 
who can be signed for mimimum cost, i.e. someone on the waiver wire or a Minor League free
agent. 0.0 <span class="caps">WAR</span> over a season denotes a replacement-level player, 2.0 is a regular 
starter, 5.0 is All-Star worthy and a <span class="caps">WAR</span> of 8 or above means the player is worthy of <span class="caps">MVP</span>&nbsp;consideration. </p>
<p><strong>fWAR: Fangraph.com&#8217;s <span class="caps">WAR</span> calculation, which includes <span class="caps">FIP</span> for pitchers, and <span class="caps">UZR</span> for 
defense (see&nbsp;above)</strong></p>
<p><strong>rWAR: Baseball-Reference.com&#8217;s <span class="caps">WAR</span> calculation, which includes defensive runs
saved (plus-minus) when calculating pitching, TotalZone for defense, and&nbsp;baserunning</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WARP</span>: Wins above replacement player according to Baseball&nbsp;Prospectus</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WHIP</span>: Walks and Hits Per Innings Pitched</strong>        <code>(W + H)/IP</code> </p>
<p>The number of walks and hits allowed by a pitcher per inning. Essentially, this equals 
baserunners per inning. A <span class="caps">WHIP</span> of 1 or below is considered elite. The average <span class="caps">WHIP</span> across
<span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 was&nbsp;1.32.</p>
<p><strong>wOBA: Weighted On Base&nbsp;Average</strong></p>
<p>A single stat that takes into account how a player gets on base, not just that a player 
gets on base, by assigning more value to extra-base hits. wOBA weighs each aspect of 
hitting in proportion to its run value, unlike <span class="caps">OPS</span>. The average wOBA across <span class="caps">MLB</span> in 2011 
was&nbsp;.316.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WPA</span>: Win Probability&nbsp;Added</strong></p>
<p>A calculation of how a player affects his team&#8217;s win expectancy from play to play, over 
the course of a game. For example, a player who homers in a late-and-close situation will 
have a higher <span class="caps">WPA</span> than one who strikes&nbsp;out.</p>
